INTRODUCTION                        *notepad*

A very, very simple Vim plugin that offers a nice syntax higlighting and some
very non-spectacular keybindings making it easier to write timestamped notes
in vim.

KEYBINDINGS                         *notepad-keybindings*

<C-i>           Insert a new note at the very top of the file.
